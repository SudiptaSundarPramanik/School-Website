                The canteen was so big and many students sat there and ate their lunch. It was build in 1998 and was destroyed in 2011. The reason to destroy it is a new building was required to build as the population of the students was very much. In the canteen, we can get all types of food and snacks.

                1. Accuracy
                Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                <br>
                2. Economics
                Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                <br>
                3. Productivity / Efficiency
                Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
                <br>
                4. Visibility / Insights
                Would you need a quick snapshot of all planned and unplanned absences for an employee or group? With just a few clicks, you can generate accurate reports on hours worked, absences, overtime, get a monthly summary report for any of the data/groups within the organization. Any customized report can be generated with the centralized data which improves visibility and transparency within the organization. Managers can also make use of the graphical views of the report to get a quick and easy understanding of attendance data. With a centralized, accurate attendance data hub, employers can strategically analyze and improve policies on leave, hours, workplace culture, performance, pay, etc., thereby enabling them to mature in the way they operate.
                <br>
                5. Hassle Free Workflow Management
                An integrated attendance management system can provide good visibility of all data and can ease the workflow of payrolls, leaves and performance reviews. Notifications/alerts are automated and the manager can approve requests for early departure, overtime, etc., immediately without any specific need for communication. Forget the herculean task of manual scheduling. With just a few clicks, an automated attendance management system can help manage schedules, allocate work, and easily keep track of shift swaps. It can also help you to forecast workloads, resources, and budgets.
                <br>
                6. Flexibility
                In today’s global, well-connected environment, you have employees working from office, from home, or at remote locations. An attendance management system allows organizations to track employee time using a variety of clocking options, such as smartphones, internet networks, swiping technologies, biometric terminals or desktop readers easily.
                <br>
                7. Integration / Configuration
                You can choose attendance management systems to suit your needs based on the nature of work and policies. There are systems available which can be integrated with any third-party attendance hardware (swipe, biometric), and which can capture GPS-based attendance with mobile applications. You can create customized attendance policies as per your organizational needs with time tracking and attendance monitoring systems. You can have individual configurations for each attendance shift, with options to define attendance cycles, mark-in/out rules, leave deductions, and optional holidays.
                <br>
                8. Real-time tracking
                Cloud-based attendance management enables real-time tracking and provides automated inputs for payroll processing. This helps in managing alternative payment schedules and makes all information available in real time. Managers can create “scheduled versus actual” reports to adjust work schedules and direct workforce activities in real time.
                <br>
                9. Security
                Most attendance management systems are built around highly secure systems and architecture. Specifically, biometric systems are highly reliable and secure and can help prevent time theft, buddy punching and reduce administrative costs stemming from forgotten PINs and lost ID cards. These systems are of particular utility to organizations where security is a primary concern.
                <br>
                10. Compliance
                Inaccurate records can cost your organization a lot of money in overtime payment, and can also violate labor laws, resulting in expensive legal defence and fines. Regulations require that employers track attendance and provide the necessary compensation to their employees for any excess hours worked in the spirit of fairness. An attendance management system that integrates with your payroll simplifies this process while making it seamless.
